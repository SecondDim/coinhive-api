# coinhive-api
This is not the official repository of [CoinHive][coinhive].  
The goal of this repository is to develop some useful module in Python and PHP for [CoinHive HTTP API][coinhive_http_api],  
in order to make the people who want to operate [CoinHive HTTP API][coinhive_http_api] more easier.  

I just make a web miner website by coinhive.  
In this website,  
you can mine monero for yourself in a very easy way.  
Just input your site key,  
then click `Start Mining!!!` button,  
the website will launch [CoinHive Simple Miner UI][coinhive_simple_miner_ui] for you.  
You do not need to install any application or program in your computer or smart phone,  
just open your browser and start mining!!!  

## Demo
You can try my first demo site [here][demo].
