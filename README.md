# coinhive-api
This is not the official repository of [CoinHive][coinhive].
The goal of this repository is to develop some useful module in Python and PHP for [CoinHive HTTP API][coinhive_http_api],
in order to make the people who want to operate CoinHive HTTP API more easier.

I just make a web miner website by coinhive.
In this website,
you can mine monero for yourself in a very easy way.
Just input your site key,
then click `Start Mining!!!` button,
the website will launch [CoinHive Simple Miner UI][coinhive_simple_miner_ui] for you.
You do not need to install any application or program in your computer or smart phone,
just open your browser and start mining!!!

## Demo
You can try my first demo site [here][demo].
